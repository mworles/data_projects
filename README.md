This repository provides a central listing of code, workbooks, and reports from 
my data science work. 

## About Me
I'm a quantitative researcher with a Ph.D. in psychology and 11 years of experience 
as lead statistician for scientific research teams. I have a strong background 
in statistics and experimental design, along with strong programming and 
machine learning skills acquired through end-to-end projects. 
In my current position as an Assistant Professor at the University of California 
San Diego, I serve as a consulting data scientist for scientific investigators.

## Workbooks
Notebooks with code, annotation, and data
visualizations from short projects or modular steps of large projects.
