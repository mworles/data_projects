## About Me
I'm a quantitative research psychologist with 11 years of experience in a lead data role for scientific research teams. I have a strong educational and applied background in statistics and experimental design, along with end-to-end project experience in programming and machine learning. In my current position as an Assistant Professor at the University of California, San Diego, I lead a  behavioral economics research project and serve as a consulting data scientist for several research groups. My data science interests are mainly in sports analytics and predictive analytics. Contact me at majaworley@gmail.com.
