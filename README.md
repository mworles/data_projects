## About Me
I'm a quantitative research psychologist at the University of California, San Diego with 11 years of experience in a lead data role for scientific research teams. I have a strong educational and applied background in statistics and experimental design, along with end-to-end project experience in programming and machine learning. In my current position as an Assistant Professor, I am lead investigator on a behavioral economics research project and serve as a consulting data scientist for several research groups. My data science interests are mainly in sports analytics and predictive analytics.
