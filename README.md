## About Me
I'm a quantitative research psychologist with 11 years of experience in a lead data role for scientific research teams. I have a strong educational and applied background in statistics and experimental design, along with end-to-end project experience in programming and machine learning. In my current position as an Assistant Professor at the University of California San Diego, I lead a behavioral economics research project and serve as a consulting data scientist for several research groups.

## About this Portfolio
This repository is central listing of code, workbooks, and reports from data science projects.

The portfolio contains four sections:

[Workbooks](#workbooks) - Jupyter notebooks with explanation and code from brief projects. Links are organized by topic or function.  
[Major Project Repositories](#major-project-repositories) - Repositories containing code and other materials for larger end-to-end projects.  
[Major Project Reports](#major-project-reports) - Full written reports from end-to-end projects with summary of strategy and results.  
[Blog Posts and Slides](#blog-posts-and-slides) - Quick reads from data science projects including blog posts and slide decks.
