## About Me
I'm a quantitative researcher with a Ph.D. in psychology and 11 years of experience 
as lead statistician for scientific research teams. I have a strong background 
in statistics and experimental design, along with strong programming and 
machine learning skills acquired through end-to-end projects. 
In my current position as an Assistant Professor at the University of California 
San Diego, I serve as a consulting data scientist for scientific investigators.
